**OSINT-based Blue Team analysis of cybersecurity incident trends affecting South Korea’s financial sector (2020–2025)**

---

## Project Overview

This project is an open-source intelligence (OSINT)–based analysis of cybersecurity incidents affecting South Korea’s financial sector between 2020 and 2025. It examines publicly reported incidents, national guidance, and regulatory responses to identify threat trends, defensive gaps, and evolving response strategies.

---

## Project Type

- Blue Team / SOC-style analysis  
- OSINT-based (no internal or classified access)

---

## Executive Summary

This project examines cyber breaches in South Korea’s financial sector between 2020 and 2025 using open-source intelligence (OSINT) methods. It focuses on incident trends, common attack methods, and national response measures within the financial sector.

---

## Hypothesis

Since 2020, the South Korean financial sector has experienced increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, with national responses becoming more proactive in prevention, detection, and mitigation.

## Scope and Objectives

### Scope
- **Timeframe:** 2020–2025  
- **Sector focus:** Banks, fintech companies, payment platforms  
- **Data sources:** Publicly reported incidents, FSC guidance, government advisories, and news reports  

### Objectives
- Identify trends in cyber incidents affecting the financial sector  
- Analyse common attack methods and threat activity  
- Illustrate findings through case examples  
- Highlight cybersecurity gaps and identify areas for improvement within the sector  

---

## Methodology

### Approach
OSINT-based analysis using publicly available information.

### Data Collection
- Incident reports from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and other financial authorities  
- Press releases and news reporting  

### Source Evaluation
- Assessment of source reliability and relevance  

### Data Analysis
- Categorisation of incident types  
- Identification of patterns over time  

### Illustrative Case Studies
- Selection of one to two significant incidents  
- Analysis of how responses and preventative measures have evolved  

### Limitations
- Analysis relies solely on open-source reporting  
- Limited visibility into internal response timelines and effectiveness of implemented measures

## Key Findings

- Cyber threats targeting South Korea’s financial sector have increased since 2020, with phishing and voice phishing emerging as common attack methods.  
- Several incidents reveal long-standing cybersecurity weaknesses, including insufficient monitoring and delayed detection.  
- National guidance increasingly prioritises preventative controls and early detection over post-incident response.  
- Regulatory oversight and public disclosure place pressure on financial institutions to meet minimum cybersecurity standards.  
- The Lotte Card data breach illustrates how persistent vulnerabilities can remain undetected without continuous monitoring.  

---

## Conclusion

In summary, open-source reporting suggests that South Korea’s financial sector has faced increasingly sophisticated cyber threats since 2020, particularly through phishing-based campaigns. Regulatory responses indicate a shift toward preventative measures, with greater emphasis on monitoring, threat detection, and compliance with standards set by regulatory bodies. Case examples such as the Lotte Card breach highlight how long-term vulnerabilities can persist without effective preventative controls. While this analysis relies solely on publicly available information, the findings indicate that South Korea’s financial cybersecurity posture is gradually moving toward a more preventative and risk-focused approach.
